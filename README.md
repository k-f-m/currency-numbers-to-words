# Currency to Words Converter
This repository presents a single page application (SPA) that uses ASP.NET Core 8 and Angular 17 to convert currency numbers into equivalent words.

The conversion takes place on the server with extensive multi-level input validation. Feedback is provided to the user for a wide range of input combinations, including data entry errors.
